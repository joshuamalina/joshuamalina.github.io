# Josh Malina - IFS Coaching

Hi! I'm Josh. I am an Internal Family Systems (IFS) Coach and Mindfulness teacher living and working in Washington D.C.

## About

I beleive that real healing is possible, and through tools like the Internal Family Systems model, and mindfulness based practices, we can make real progress inestablishing space, freedom and growth in our minds and in our lives.

I have been a daily meditator since 2017, and try to attend a retreat once a year. In 2023, I started  teaching Saturday mindfulness classes to women transitioning out of homelessness. I took Derek Scott's IFSCA stepping stones course. I am also the teacher coordinator for the Sunday night sangha, Downtown Dharma, in Washington D.C.

## How it works

Most sessions take place in my home in Woodley Park, DC, though I am open to working remotely with clients who do not live locally. 

I charge $75 per 50 minute session, but offer a sliding scale for clients who cannot afford this rate.
